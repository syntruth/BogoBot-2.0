BogoBot Version 2.1.0
#####################

Created by Randy "syntruth" Carnahan

BogoBot is a Ruby-based IRC bot, that can load plugins to add custom
commands and irc-event handlers.  It is designed to be modular, though
probably not as fast in execution speed as C-based IRC bots. (That said,
it seems fast enough for almost all uses on my server.)

BogoBot is very limited in it's core functionality; all interesting
features are meant to come from the plugin system and not from within
the bot itself. Various plugins have been made for dice rolling, magic
8-ball-esque replies, and even auto-op'ing users on a server that does
not have services available.

Plugins are easy to code, with as much of the heavy lifting done by the
bot itself, exposing helper methods to do things like open storage files
or obtain a text format for bold, colored text.

BogoBot uses a custom-hacked version of the Ruby-IRC library. I have
extended this library to do add two things: formatted IRC text and 
handling of CTCP events. (IRCTextUtil and IRCCTCP respecitively.) I'll
try to get around to submitting these changes to the Ruby-IRC authors
for their approval and hopeful inclusion eventually.

The only gem required is the Daemons gem:

    gem install daemons

Then, to launch the bot, change to it's working directory and run the
bogobot.rb file.  (It's set up to use /usr/bin/env ruby if you make it
executable.)

It has the following options:

-c, --config=
  Specifies the config file to use for the bot. Defaults to 'default.conf'.
  You do not need to put the '.conf' on the end.

-d, --daemon
  Puts the Bot into the background. The default is to not daemonize the bot.

-h, --help
  Prints the help text.  You are reading this now. ;)

For help on writing a plugin, please see the PLUGIN file.

Owners
------

The bot requires at least _one_ owner defined in the bot's configuration
file. This entry is in the following syntax:

nick:password

...where nick is the owner's nick; this is CASE SENSITIVE.

...and the password is the md5 hex-value of the password.

At this time, that is all there is. Eventually I hope to have nick-mask
and host-mask checking as well.
