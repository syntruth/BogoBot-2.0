BogoBot Plugin How-To
#####################

The Basics
----------

A BogoBot plugin is simple a ruby file located in BogoBot's plugin
directory (default: plugins/) that uses the Plugin class' language
to define the plugin.

This would be a minimum plugin:

  Plugin.define :myplugin do
    name    "My Plugin"
    author  "syntruth"
    version "1.0"

    command :echo do |event|
      msg = event.message
      event.reply(msg)
    end

    help_for :echo do
      "Echos whatever is given after {cmd}echo and not much else."
    end
  end

...that would define the !echo command, which takes whatever text is 
passed to it and echos it back to the channel, or if the user issued
the !echo command in private, back in a private message to that user.
You don't have to worry about checking for public vs private messages,
the event and bot handles that for you.

A basic, bare-bones (but working) plugin is provided in the plugins
directory called plugin_template.rb -- you can use this file as the
starting point for your own plugins.

The Config class
----------------

Every plugin is passed an instance of the Config::Config class to its
start() method.  This is a simple container class that is typically used
with it's get() and set() methods. This instance does not necessarily mean
that the plugin has a config file and it was read; if the file doesn't
exist, the instance will represent an empty config file. The most useful
methods are these:

  has_read? -- has the config file been read?  This will be true if the
  file exists and the bot opened it. If the file existed, then of course
  it has not been read yet.

  on_disk? -- is the config file on the physical disk? If the config doesn't
  exist, this is a safe method to check before trying to do anything with it.
  Once the file has been saved, this will return as true.

  get(key[, default_value]) -- this will retrieve a key from the config. If
  the key does not exist, it will return nil, unless you give the second,
  optional argument, in which case, that value will be returned if the key
  does not exist.

  set(key, value) -- sets the key to value.  Only strings and arrays are
  handled by the Config class.

For more, I suggest reading over the Config class in lib/config.rb.

Handy BogoBot Plugin Helpers
----------------------------

There are a few helper methods that are useful to know that are exposed by
Bogobot:

  get_storage_path(filename) -- this will return the string path of where 
  a plugin's storage file (for non-config data) can be kept. But, perhaps
  even better is...

  get_storage_file(filename, mode) -- this method takes a block, that 
  should accept an open file object, just like ruby's open() method. This
  file will be closed at the end of the block. If there is an issue with
  opening the file, then nil is passed to the block instead, so make sure
  to check for it.

  get_format_string(options={}) -- if you need to wrap some outgoing message
  in font colors or format, such a bold, you can call this method with a hash
  of options. It will return a format string to be used with the % operator
  that you can insert your message into. If there is an error, it returns
  just '%s' instead. The options are these:

    Formats: :bold, :fixed, :italic, :reverse, :underline

    In the hash, set those as keys with the value of true.

    Colors: :white, :black, :dark_blue, :dark_green, :light_red,
    :dark_red, :magenta, :orange, :yellow, :light_green, :cyan, 
    :light_blue, :light_magenta, :grey, :light_grey

    For colors, you set a key of :color, :foreground or :fg for the 
    foreground color, and :background or :bg for the background color, the
    value being one of the colors above.

    Thus, to set a bold text, with blue color on a white background:

    options = {:bold => true, :fg => :light_blue, :bg => :white}

  is_owner?(nick) -- this will return true if the given IRC nick is a
  logged in owner of the bot.
